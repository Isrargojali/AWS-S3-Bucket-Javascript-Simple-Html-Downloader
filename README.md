AWS-S3-Bucket-Javascript-Simple-Html-Downloader
This documentation will guide you through the process of using the provided HTML and JavaScript code to create a web interface for browsing and downloading files from an Amazon S3 bucket using pre-signed URLs.

**Prerequisites**
An Amazon Web Services (AWS) account with an S3 bucket set up.
AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key with appropriate permissions to access the S3 bucket.
Getting Started

**Clone the Repository:**

Start by cloning the GitHub repository that contains the provided code to your local machine.

**bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git**
**Configure AWS Credentials:
**
Open the index.html file in the repository and locate the following lines:

**javascript
Copy code
var awsConfig = {
    accessKeyId: 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
    secretAccessKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY',
    region: 'us-east-1'
};**
Replace 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID' and 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' with your actual AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

Set S3 Bucket Name:

In the same index.html file, find the following line:

**javascript
Copy code
Bucket: 'allautomadic', // Replace with your bucket name
Replace 'allautomadic' with the name of your S3 bucket.**

**Deploy the Code:

You can host the HTML file on any web server or hosting platform that supports static HTML hosting. You can also run it locally using a local server.
**
Usage
Access the Web Interface:
**
Open a web browser and navigate to the URL where your index.html file is hosted or opened locally.
**
****Browse S3 Bucket Contents:
************
**Upon loading, the web interface will display the contents of the root directory of your S3 bucket.
You can click on folder names to navigate into subfolders and view their contents.
Download Files:**

Files will be listed with a "Download" button.
Click the "Download" button next to a file to initiate the download using a pre-signed URL.
Back Button:

You can navigate back to the parent folder using the "Back" button located at the top of the page.
Customization
You can customize the CSS styles in the <style> section of the HTML code to match your preferred design.

**Security Considerations
Ensure that you keep your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key secure and avoid hardcoding them in the code if sharing the code publicly.
